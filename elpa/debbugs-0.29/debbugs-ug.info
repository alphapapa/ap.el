Debbugs User Guide
******************

Debbugs is a bugtracking system (BTS) that was initially written for the
Debian project but currently used also by the GNU project.  The main
distinctive feature of Debbugs is that it's mostly email-based.  All
actions on bug reports: opening, closing, changing the status,
commenting, forwarding are performed via email by sending specially
composed letters to the particular email addresses.  However, searching
the bug reports, querying bug report status and viewing comments have
been web-based for a long time.  To overcome this inconvenience the
Debbugs/SOAP service was introduced.

   Based on the Debbugs/SOAP service, frontends are written which offer
handling of bugs inside Emacs.  These frontends are restricted to the
GNU Debbugs server.  Bugs are presented either as tabulated list
('debbugs-gnu') or as 'org-mode' TODO list ('debbugs-org', *note Org
Mode: (org)Top.).  As backend they use the 'debbugs' Emacs library
(*note Debbugs Programmer's Manual: (debbugs)Top.).

1 Retrieving Bugs
*****************

Bugs are retrieved by the 'debbugs-gnu' or 'debbugs-org' commands.  In
their simple version, they retrieve just bugs for the '"emacs"' package
on the GNU Debbugs server, filtered by bug severities.  Further
filtering is possible when the commands are called with a prefix.

   When the bug numbers to be retrieved are known, the commands
'debbugs-gnu-bugs' or 'debbugs-org-bugs' are applicable.

   The commands 'debbugs-gnu-patches' / 'debbugs-org-patches',
'debbugs-gnu-tagged' / 'debbugs-org-tagged' and
'debbugs-gnu-emacs-release-blocking-reports' /
'debbugs-org-emacs-release-blocking-reports' retrieve bugs with a
predefined filter.

 -- Command: debbugs-gnu severities &optional packages archivedp
          suppress tags
 -- Command: debbugs-org severities &optional packages archivedp
          suppress tags

     These commands retrieve bug reports from the GNU Debbugs server.
     'debbugs-gnu' returns a tabulated list, and 'debbugs-org' returns a
     list of TODO items in 'org-mode'.  In order not to stress the GNU
     Debbugs server, the bugs are retrieved in chunks of 500 bugs.
     However, the bug report buffer shows all retrieved bugs then, in
     reverse bug number order.

     SEVERITIES is a list of strings which filter for the severities of
     the bugs to be retrieved.  Valid severities are '"serious"',
     '"important"', '"normal"', '"minor"' and '"wishlist"' (see also the
     constant 'debbugs-gnu-all-severities').  If the list is empty,
     there is no filtering with respect to severities.  The keyword
     '"tagged"', which is also possible, is not a severity in the GNU
     Debbugs server but allows restricting the result to bugs with a
     given user tag.

     PACKAGES, also a list of strings, points to the defined software
     packages on the GNU Debbugs server which should be taken into
     account.  The existing package names are compiled into the constant
     'debbugs-gnu-all-packages'.

     ARCHIVEDP, if non-'nil', extends the retrieval to also apply to
     archived bugs on the GNU Debbugs server.

     When SUPPRESS is non-'nil', closed bugs are suppressed from being
     retrieved from the Debbugs server.  Which bugs are regarded as
     suppressed is configured via the user option
     'debbugs-gnu-suppress-bugs'.  By default bugs marked as '"done"'
     are suppressed from being retrieved.

     When SEVERITIES contains the severity '"tagged"', TAGS is consulted
     in order to restrict the result to bugs which are tagged with one
     of the strings of the list TAGS.  This list can also be empty; in
     this case locally tagged bugs are included in the results.

     When called interactively, the commands require just the SEVERITIES
     and the TAGS (if SEVERITIES includes '"tagged"').  In order to
     provide the other arguments interactively, the commands must be
     called with a prefix, like 'C-u M-x debbugs-gnu'.  In the
     minibuffer, lists must be entered separated by commas.

     Default values for interactive use can be configured with the user
     options 'debbugs-gnu-default-severities' and
     'debbugs-gnu-default-packages'.

     *note Presenting Bugs:: for the presentation of the results.

 -- Command: debbugs-gnu-package &optional packages

     This command shows all bugs for a given list of PACKAGES, sorted by
     severity and whether already resolved.  It is
     'debbugs-gnu-default-packages' per default.

     If the package '"emacs"' is member of the PACKAGES list, also all
     unresolved bugs for the next Emacs release are shown, like
     'debbugs-gnu-emacs-release-blocking-reports' does (see below).

     *note Presenting Bugs:: for the presentation of the results.

 -- Command: debbugs-gnu-bugs &rest bugs
 -- Command: debbugs-org-bugs &rest bugs

     The commands 'debbugs-gnu-bugs' and 'debbugs-org-bugs' show bugs
     specified by their bug number.  Interactively, the bug numbers must
     be entered as a comma-separated list of bugs or bug ranges.

     A bug range has the form '12345-21345' or '-123'.  In the former
     case, all bugs from 12345 until 21345 are presented, and in the
     latter case the last 123 bugs are shown, counting from the highest
     bug number in the repository.

     A default value for interactive use can be configured in the user
     option 'debbugs-gnu-default-bug-number-list'.

     *note Presenting Bugs:: for the presentation of the results.

 -- Command: debbugs-gnu-patches
 -- Command: debbugs-org-patches

     The commands 'debbugs-gnu-patches' and 'debbugs-org-patches' show
     all unarchived bugs of the packages declared in
     'debbugs-gnu-default-packages', and tagged with '"patch"'.  This is
     useful for bug triaging.

     *note Presenting Bugs:: for the presentation of the results.

 -- Command: debbugs-gnu-tagged
 -- Command: debbugs-org-tagged

     The commands 'debbugs-gnu-tagged' and 'debbugs-org-tagged' show all
     bugs tagged locally.  This list is useful for keeping track of bugs
     you are currently working on.

     *note Presenting Bugs:: for the presentation of the results.

 -- Command: debbugs-gnu-emacs-release-blocking-reports &optional
          release
 -- Command: debbugs-org-emacs-release-blocking-reports &optional
          release

     The package '"emacs"' has the additional commands
     'debbugs-gnu-emacs-release-blocking-reports' and
     'debbugs-org-emacs-release-blocking-reports', which show all
     blocking bugs for a given Emacs release.  The user option
     'debbugs-gnu-emacs-current-release' contains the release number the
     blocking reports are selected for; a prefix argument allows to
     change this when called interactively.

 -- User Option: debbugs-show-progress

     If this user option is non-'nil', a progress report is shown when
     retrieving bugs, defaults to t.

2 Searching in the Debbugs Database
***********************************

The GNU Debbugs server allows searching the text of the messages
submitted to the bugs in the database.  It uses a HyperEstraier based
search engine
(https://fallabs.com/hyperestraier/uguide-en.html#searchcond)(1).

   The search engine uses an index over the bug database.  This index is
refreshed daily; search hits may not include recent changes made the
same day.

 -- Command: debbugs-gnu-search
 -- Command: debbugs-org-search

     Both these commands are completely interactive.  They ask for a
     '"search phrase"' for the text search.  It is just a string which
     contains the words to be searched for followed by each other.  If
     there are operators like "AND", "ANDNOT" and "OR" between the
     words, the search happens for words at different positions in the
     text.  Only complete words, contained in a message body, are
     searched for.

     Wildcard searches are also supported.  It can be used for forward
     match search and backward match search of words.  For example,
     "[BW] euro" matches words which begin with "euro".  "[EW] sphere"
     matches words which end with "sphere".  Moreover, regular
     expressions are also supported.  For example, "[RX] ^inter.*al$"
     matches words which begin with "inter" and end with "al".(2)
     Several wildcards must be separated by the operators explained
     above.

     While the words to be searched for are case insensitive, the
     operators must be specified in upper case.

     While the search for the phrase is performed only in the bodies of
     the messages belonging to a bug report, it is also possible to
     restrict the search using further bug attributes.  The commands ask
     for such attribute-value pairs, until an empty attribute is
     returned.  Possible attributes are

     'severity'
          A comma-separated list of bug severities, *Note Retrieving
          Bugs::.

     'package'
          A comma-separated list of defined software packages on the GNU
          Debbugs server, *Note Retrieving Bugs::.

     'tags'
          A comma-separated list of defined user tags.

     'author'
          The email address of a message originator.

     'date'
          A time period during which the bug has been submitted or
          modified.

     'subject'
          Word(s) contained in the subject of the bug report.

     'status'
          The status of the bug report.  Valid values are "open",
          "forwarded" and "done".

     It is also possible to apply these commands with an empty search
     phrase.  In this case, the GNU Debbugs server is searched only for
     bugs which match the given attributes.  The attributes to be
     applied are the same as already described, plus

     'archive'
          Whether archived bugs shall be searched (no value to be
          entered).

     'src'
          Bugs which belong to a given source, if that attribute is set.

     'tag'
          An arbitrary string the bug is annotated with.  Usually, this
          is the same as the status mentioned above.

     'owner'
     'submitter'
     'maint'
     'correspondent'
          The email address of the bug's owner, submitter, maintainer,
          or correspondent (somebody who has participated in bug
          messages).

     'log_modified'
     'last_modified'
     'found_date'
     'fixed_date'
          The date of the last update, or the date of the bug report /
          bug fix.

     'unarchived'
          The date the bug was unarchived, if ever.

     'done'
          The email address of the worker who closed the bug (if done).

     'forwarded'
          A URL or an email address.

     'msgid'
          The message id of the initial bug report.

     'summary'
          The summary of the bug report.

     Not all of these attributes can be queried on the GNU Debbugs
     server via the Debbugs/SOAP backend.  In this case, the results of
     a query are filtered on the client side, which is indicated by the
     string "(client-side filter)" in the minibuffer after the attribute
     name.  Note, that client side filters perform badly, because they
     can be applied only after all bugs have been downloaded.

     These commands show also a progress report when
     'debbugs-show-progress' is non-'nil'.

Debbugs server only.

   (2) Simplified forms, as described in the Hyperestraier User Guide,
are not supported.

3 Presenting Bugs
*****************

The commands described in the previous chapters generate (a) report
buffer(s) applicable for navigation.  'debbugs-gnu-*' displays a
tabulated list, and 'debbugs-org-*' displays a list of TODO items in
'org-mode'.

* Menu:

* Tabulated Lists::             Tabulated Lists.
* TODO Items::                  TODO Items.
* Control Messages::            Control Messages.
* Applying Patches::            Applying Patches in the Emacs Repository.
* Posting Patches::             Posting Patches to Debbugs from the Emacs Repository.


File: debbugs-ug.info,  Node: Tabulated Lists,  Next: TODO Items,  Up: Presenting Bugs

3.1 Tabulated Lists
===================

A tabulated list of bug reports consisting of four columns for every bug
entry: 'Id' (the bug number), 'State' (some bug attributes), 'Submitter'
(the name of the bug submitter), and 'Title' (the bug subject).  By
default the bugs are sorted descending by 'Id'; this can be changed by
clicking in the headline.

   Different foreground colors represent further information on the bug
report.  If the bug number uses a red color ('debbugs-gnu-tagged'), the
bug has been tagged locally.  The same face is used to mark bugs in the
submitter or title column, when the bug has been reported / is
maintained by the user.

   The bug state can appear in different colors: red ('debbugs-gnu-new',
nobody has answered this bug yet), ForestGreen ('debbugs-gnu-handled',
the bug has been modified recently), MidnightBlue
('debbugs-gnu-pending', the bug is pending), orange
('debbugs-gnu-stale', the bug has not been touched for a while), and
DarkGrey ('debbugs-gnu-done', the bug is closed).  Archived bugs are
shown with inverse face ('debbugs-gnu-archived').

   A DarkGrey background color ('debbugs-gnu-marked') in the title
column shows bugs which have been marked locally.

   The minor mode 'debbugs-gnu-mode' is active in bug report buffers.
This enables the following key strokes:

'<RET>'        'debbugs-gnu-select-report'
'<mouse-1>'    Show the email messages that discuss the bug.
'<mouse-2>'    
               
'A'            'debbugs-gnu-select-current-bugs'
               Show the email messages for all currently displayed
               messages (including merged reports).  Limited by user
               option 'debbugs-gnu-select-bugs-limit'.
               
'd'            'debbugs-gnu-display-status'
               Show all bug attributes.
               
'/'            'debbugs-gnu-narrow-to-status'
               Narrow the list of bugs to the bugs that match the given
               regex in 'State', 'Submitter' or 'Title'.  With a prefix
               argument 'C-u', the list of bugs is narrowed to a match
               in 'State' only.
               
'R'            'debbugs-gnu-show-all-blocking-reports'
               Narrow the list of bug reports to the ones that are
               blocking the current Emacs release, as specified in
               'debbugs-gnu-emacs-current-release'.  With a prefix
               argument 'C-u', the current Emacs release is read from
               the minibuffer.
               
'w'            'debbugs-gnu-widen'
               Restore the full list again after narrowing.
               
'g'            'debbugs-gnu-rescan'
               Reload all bugs.  With a prefix argument 'C-u', the bug
               status cache is disabled, and all bug reports are
               retrieved from the GNU Debbugs server.
               
'B'            'debbugs-gnu-show-blocking-reports'
'b'            'debbugs-gnu-show-blocked-by-reports'
               Show all bug reports which are blocking / blocked by
               this bug.
               
's'            'debbugs-gnu-toggle-sort'
               Toggle sorting order of bugs.
               
't'            'debbugs-gnu-toggle-tag'
               Toggle local tag of bugs.
               
'm'            'debbugs-gnu-toggle-mark'
               Toggle local mark of bugs.
               
'x'            'debbugs-gnu-toggle-suppress'
               Toggle showing of closed bugs.
               
'C'            'debbugs-gnu-send-control-message'
               Send a control message for this bug,
               *note Control Messages::.
               
'E'            'debbugs-gnu-make-control-message'
               Make (but don't send) a control message for this bug,
               *note Control Messages::.

   Tagging a bug locally via 't' is an efficient way to keep bugs
visible you are working on.  The command 'debbugs-gnu-tagged' shows all
locally tagged bugs in a list.

   Marking a bug locally via 'm' is meant for single sessions.  This is
a mean to mark bugs for different reasons, like marking a bug in a list
you have processed already during a bug triage.

   Both tagged and marked bugs are kept persistent in the file
'debbugs-gnu-persistency-file'.

   The user option 'debbugs-gnu-suppress-closed' controls whether closed
bugs are shown in the initial list.

   The user option 'debbugs-gnu-mail-backend' controls the presentation
of email messages produced by typing '<RET>' or by clicking the mouse on
a bug: if its value is 'gnus', the default, a GNUS ephemeral group for
that bug will be shown; if its value is 'rmail', the command will
present an Rmail folder instead.


File: debbugs-ug.info,  Node: TODO Items,  Next: Control Messages,  Prev: Tabulated Lists,  Up: Presenting Bugs

3.2 TODO Items
==============

TODO items are offered as usual in 'org-mode'.  The bug attributes are
mapped onto properties of these items.  They can be shown by the usual
navigation in 'org-mode'.

   Bug severities are mapped onto org severities, see
'debbugs-org-severity-priority'.

   The minor mode 'debbugs-org-mode' is active in bug report buffers.
This enables the following key strokes:

'<TAB>'     'org-cycle'
            Outline the bug report attributes in 'org-mode'.
            
'C-c # d'   'debbugs-gnu-display-status'
            Show all bug attributes.
            
'C-c # t'   'debbugs-gnu-toggle-tag'
            Toggle local tag of bugs.
            
'C-c # m'   'debbugs-gnu-toggle-mark'
            Toggle local mark of bugs.
            
'C-c # C'   'debbugs-gnu-send-control-message'
            Send a control message for this bug, *note Control Messages::.
            
'C-c # E'   'debbugs-gnu-make-control-message'
            Make (but don't send) a control message for this bug, *note Control Messages::.

   When the bug attributes are shown by 'org-cycle', there is a link
'Messages' which opens the messages for that bug.  The user options
'debbugs-gnu-suppress-closed' and 'debbugs-gnu-mail-backend' have the
same meaning as in *note Tabulated Lists::.


File: debbugs-ug.info,  Node: Control Messages,  Next: Applying Patches,  Prev: TODO Items,  Up: Presenting Bugs

3.3 Control Messages
====================

Debbugs control messages are sent by email to the GNU Debbugs control
server.  Their format is described in
<https://debbugs.gnu.org/server-control.html>.

   A control message can be initiated in the tabulated list of bugs, in
the list of org TODO items, or in the GNUS ephemeral group or Rmail
folder opened for the messages belonging to a given bug.  Control
messages can be sent to unarchived bugs only, in case a bug is archived
the control message 'unarchive' must be sent first.

   In the minibuffer, the following control messages can be requested
(assuming that 12345 is the bug the control message is intended for).
The strings show the exact format of the control messages.  For the
meaning of the control messages, *Note Mail Command Index::.

'block'
'unblock'
     "block|unblock 12345 by 54321"

     The second bug number is read interactively.  It could be also a
     list of comma-separated bug numbers.

'close'
'done'
     "close 12345 25.1"

     The second argument, the Emacs version, is read interactively if
     the bug belongs to the '"emacs"' package.

'confirmed'
'easy'
'help'
'moreinfo'
'notabug'
'patch'
'pending'
'security'
'unreproducible'
'wontfix'
     "tags 12345 confirmed|easy|help|moreinfo|notabug"

     "tags 12345 patch|pending|security|unreproducible|wontfix"

     If the command invoking the control message has been prefixed with
     'C-u', the respective tag is removed from the bug, like

     "tags 12345 - confirmed"

'donenotabug'
'doneunreproducible'
'donewontfix'
     "tags 12345 notabug|unreproducible|wontfix"
     "close 12345 25.1"

     The second argument in the close message, the Emacs version, is
     read interactively if the bug belongs to the '"emacs"' package.

'found'
'notfound'
'fixed'
'notfixed'
     "found|notfound|fixed|notfixed 12345 25.1"

     The second argument, the Emacs version, is read interactively if
     the bug belongs to the '"emacs"' package.

'forwarded'
     "forwarded 12345 ADDRESS"

     The address, an email address or a URL, is read interactively.

'forcemerge'
'merge'
     "forcemerge|merge 12345 54321"

     The second bug number is read interactively.  It can be also a list
     of comma-separated bug numbers.

'invalid'
     "tags 12345 notabug"
     "tags 12345 wontfix"
     "close 12345"

'noowner'
'notforwarded'
     "noowner|notforwarded 12345"

'owner'
     "owner 12345 !"

'reassign'
     "reassign 12345 PACKAGE"

     The comma-separated package names on the GNU Debbugs server are
     read interactively.  Reassigning to the pseudo package '"spam"' let
     the bug disappear from the bug database.

'reopen'

     The username, read interactively, is either a package name or an
     email address.  The tag to be set is also read interactively.

'documentation'
     "user emacs"
     "usertag 12345 documentation"

   How the control messages are sent is controlled by the
'debbugs-gnu-send-mail-function' user option.  If it is 'nil' (the
default value), the value of 'send-mail-function' is used.  This could
be inconvenient, for example when an external interactive mail client is
configured.

3.4 Applying Patches in the Emacs Repository
============================================

Several bugs carry a proposed patch in one of their messages.  Usually,
those bugs are marked with the with '"patch"' tag.  *note Retrieving
Bugs:: how to show such bugs.

   If a GNUS ephemeral group for such a bug is opened, it is possible to
apply the patch directly to the Emacs repository.  Move the cursor to
the message containing a patch, and hit 'M-m'.  It determines whether
one or several patches are in the MIME attachments or just included in
the message, applies them, runs 'make -k' in the 'lisp' subdirectory,
and shows a '*vc-dir*' buffer of the Emacs repository with the changed
file(s).

   The Emacs repository is determined via the user options
'debbugs-gnu-trunk-directory' or 'debbugs-gnu-branch-directory'.  The
latter one is used, when the patch is applied with the prefixed command
'C-u M-m'.  If the predefined directory does not point to an existing
path, it is read from the minibuffer.

   A further 'M-m' in the corresponding '*vc-diff*' buffer opens the
modified file.  Here you can apply 'M-m' again.  This creates a
ChangeLog entry with all needed information.  A final 'M-m' in the
'ChangeLog' buffer commits the patch via '*vc-log*'.


File: debbugs-ug.info,  Node: Posting Patches,  Prev: Applying Patches,  Up: Presenting Bugs

3.5 Posting Patches to Debbugs from the Emacs Repository
========================================================

Once you have committed a patch locally to fix a bug you usually want to
post it to the bug thread for review and testing.  And when the patch is
deemed satisfactory and pushed to the official repository, the bug
should be marked closed.

   The query for commit (or commit range) to use is controlled by
'debbugs-gnu-read-commit-range-hook'.  Initially it has an entry which
operates in '*vc-change-log*' buffers, but additional entries may be
added to give sensible results for other modes that work with git.

   The command 'debbugs-gnu-pick-commits' (bound to 'c' in
'*vc-change-log*' buffers by default) helps automate both these
processes: it queries for a commit (or commit range), and a bug number
(defaulting to the bug number mentioned in the commit message).  It then
jumps you to a buffer associated with the bug.  When you reply to a
message in the bug thread, you are asked whether to post the commits as
patches (optionally tagging the bug with '"patch"'), or announce that
the bug has been fixed by the selected commits (optionally closing the
bug and marking as closed in the Emacs version corresponding to the
patch).

   For example, suppose you are reading the message of "Bug#12345:
foo-mode fails to call frobnicate on startup" in a message buffer.  You
decide to fix it, so you switch to the source code, add in the missing
call and commit locally, with the commit message "* lisp/foo-mode.el
(foo-mode): Call frobnicate (Bug#12345)."  Use 'C-x v l' to run
'vc-print-log', and navigate to the new commit.  Press 'c' and then
'<RET>' to accept the default bug number (which will be 12345 since it's
in the commit message) in response to the prompt.  You are then popped
to the message buffer, and when you reply to the message, press 'p' to
post the git formatted patch as an attachment for review, and then
answer 'y' to tag the bug with '"patch"' when the message is sent.
Assuming you get favorable reviews, you then push it, and again hit 'c'
but this time press 'a' (for "announce") after replying to the relevant
bug thread message.  This will insert some text describing the commit
and where it was pushed to, and answering 'y' will arrange for the bug
to be closed when the message is sent.

3.5.1 Customizing debbugs-gnu-pick-commits
------------------------------------------

The string inserted to describe an announced commit is controlled by the
user option 'debbugs-gnu-commit-description-format', it is a format
string passed to the '--format' argument of 'git show'.  Additionally,
if the remote url matches an entry in
'debbugs-gnu-git-remote-info-alist', then its 'commit-url' subitem is
appended to the commit description.  By default this user option is
configured for the GNU Emacs and GNU ELPA repositories, more entries may
be added to work with other repositories of other packages.

4 Minor Mode
************

Emacs uses 'bug-reference.el' for adding hyperlinks to bugs in files
like 'ChangeLog', or in commentary sections of other files.  The
reference to such bugs have a specialized format, <Bug#12345>.  The
hyperlinks are implemented as minor modes 'bug-reference-mode' and
'bug-reference-prog-mode'.

   This package adds a new minor mode 'debbugs-browse-mode' on top of
them.  Instead of using the default built-in Emacs browser for a given
bug reference, it opens a corresponding bug report buffer.  The user
option 'debbugs-browse-function' controls, whether 'debbugs-gnu-bugs' or
'debbugs-org-bugs' is called.

   This minor mode is applicable for all URLs, not only bug references.
Any URL with the format <https://debbugs.gnu.org/12345> or
<https://bugs.gnu.org/54321> will be shown in a bug report buffer, when
'debbugs-browse-mode' is enabled.  See user option
'debbugs-browse-url-regexp' for the syntax of supported URLs.

   In order to enable it globally, you can add the following forms to
your '~/.emacs':

     (add-hook 'bug-reference-mode-hook 'debbugs-browse-mode)
     (add-hook 'bug-reference-prog-mode-hook 'debbugs-browse-mode)

Debbugs control mailserver commands
***********************************

'reassign bugnumber package [ version ]'
     Records that bug #bugnumber is a bug in package.  This can be used
     to set the package if the user forgot the pseudo-header, or to
     change an earlier assignment.  No notifications are sent to anyone
     (other than the usual information in the processing transcript).

     If you supply a version, the bug tracking system will note that the
     bug affects that version of the newly-assigned package.

     You can assign a bug to two packages at once by separating the
     package names with a comma.  However, you should only do this if
     the bug can be fixed by a change to either package.  If this is not
     the case, you should clone the bug and reassign the clone to the
     other package.

'reopen bugnumber [ originator-address | = | ! ]'
     Reopens #bugnumber if it is closed.

     By default, or if you specify =, the original submitter is still as
     the originator of the report, so that they will get the ack when it
     is closed again.

     If you supply an originator-address the originator will be set to
     the address you supply.  If you wish to become the new originator
     of the reopened report you can use the !  shorthand or specify your
     own email address.

     It is usually a good idea to tell the person who is about to be
     recorded as the originator that you're reopening the report, so
     that they will know to expect the ack which they'll get when it is
     closed again.

     If the bug is not closed then reopen won't do anything, not even
     change the originator.  To change the originator of an open bug
     report, use the submitter command; note that this will inform the
     original submitter of the change.

     If the bug was recorded as being closed in a particular version of
     a package but recurred in a later version, it is better to use the
     found command instead.

'found bugnumber [ version ]'
     Record that #bugnumber has been encountered in the given version of
     the package to which it is assigned.

     The bug tracking system uses this information, in conjunction with
     fixed versions recorded when closing bugs, to display lists of bugs
     open in various versions of each package.  It considers a bug to be
     open when it has no fixed version, or when it has been found more
     recently than it has been fixed.

     If no version is given, then the list of fixed versions for the bug
     is cleared.  This is identical to the behaviour of reopen.

     This command will only cause a bug to be marked as not done if no
     version is specified, or if the version being marked found is equal
     to the version which was last marked fixed.  (If you are certain
     that you want the bug marked as not done, use reopen in conjunction
     with found.

     This command was introduced in preference to reopen because it was
     difficult to add a version to that command's syntax without
     suffering ambiguity.

'notfound bugnumber version'
     Remove the record that #bugnumber was encountered in the given
     version of the package to which it is assigned.

     This differs from closing the bug at that version in that the bug
     is not listed as fixed in that version either; no information about
     that version will be known.  It is intended for fixing mistakes in
     the record of when a bug was found.

'fixed bugnumber version'
     Indicate that bug #bugnumber was fixed in the given version of the
     package to which it is assigned.  version may be a fully qualified
     version, of the form sourcepackagename/version.

     This does not cause the bug to be marked as closed, it merely adds
     another version in which the bug was fixed.  Use the bugnumber-done
     address to close a bug and mark it fixed in a particular version.

'notfixed bugnumber version'
     Remove the record that bug #bugnumber has been fixed in the given
     version.  version may be a fully qualified version, of the form
     sourcepackagename/version.

     This command is equivalent to found followed by notfound (the found
     removes the fixed at a particular version, and notfound removes the
     found) with the exception that the bug is not reopened if the found
     version is greater than any existing fixed version.  It is intended
     for fixing mistakes in the record of when a bug was fixed; in most
     cases, you actually want found, not notfixed.

'submitter bugnumber originator-address | !'
     Changes the originator of #bugnumber to originator-address.

     If you wish to become the new originator of the report you can use
     the !  shorthand or specify your own email address.

     While the reopen command changes the originator of other bugs
     merged with the one being reopened, submitter does not affect
     merged bugs.

'forwarded bugnumber address'
     Notes that bugnumber has been forwarded to the upstream maintainer
     at address.  This does not actually forward the report.  This can
     be used to change an existing incorrect forwarded-to address, or to
     record a new one for a bug that wasn't previously noted as having
     been forwarded.  address should generally be a URI, or possibly an
     email address.  Using a URI where possible allows tools to query a
     remote bug tracking system (such as bugzilla) for a bug's status.

     Example usage:

          forwarded 12345 https://bugz.illa.foo/cgi/54321

'notforwarded bugnumber'
     Forgets any idea that bugnumber has been forwarded to any upstream
     maintainer.  If the bug was not recorded as having been forwarded
     then this will do nothing.

'retitle bugnumber new-title'
     Changes the title of a bug report to that specified (the default is
     the Subject mail header from the original report).

     Unlike most of the other bug-manipulation commands when used on one
     of a set of merged reports this will change the title of only the
     individual bug requested, and not all those with which it is
     merged.

'severity bugnumber severity'
     Set the severity level for bug report #bugnumber to severity.  No
     notification is sent to the user who reported the bug.

     Severities are serious, important, normal, minor, wishlist.

     For their meanings please consult the general developers'
     documentation for the bug system.

'clone bugnumber NewID [ new IDs ... ]'
     The clone control command allows you to duplicate a bug report.  It
     is useful in the case where a single report actually indicates that
     multiple distinct bugs have occurred.  "New IDs" are negative
     numbers, separated by spaces, which may be used in subsequent
     control commands to refer to the newly duplicated bugs.  A new
     report is generated for each new ID.

     Example usage:

          clone 12345 -1 -2
          reassign -1 foo
          retitle -1 foo: foo sucks
          reassign -2 bar
          retitle -2 bar: bar sucks when used with foo
          severity -2 wishlist
          clone 123456 -3
          reassign -3 foo
          retitle -3 foo: foo sucks
          merge -1 -3

'merge bugnumber bugnumber ...'
     Merges two or more bug reports.  When reports are merged opening,
     closing, marking or unmarking as forwarded and reassigning any of
     the bugs to a new package will have an identical effect on all of
     the merged reports.

     Before bugs can be merged they must be in exactly the same state:
     either all open or all closed, with the same forwarded-to upstream
     author address or all not marked as forwarded, all assigned to the
     same package or package(s) (an exact string comparison is done on
     the package to which the bug is assigned), and all of the same
     severity.  If they don't start out in the same state you should use
     reassign, reopen and so forth to make sure that they are before
     using merge.  Titles are not required to match, and will not be
     affected by the merge.

     If any of the bugs listed in a merge command is already merged with
     another bug then all the reports merged with any of the ones listed
     will all be merged together.  Merger is like equality: it is
     reflexive, transitive and symmetric.

     Merging reports causes a note to appear on each report's logs; on
     the WWW pages this includes links to the other bugs.

     Merged reports are all expired simultaneously, and only when all of
     the reports each separately meet the criteria for expiry.

'forcemerge bugnumber bugnumber ...'
     Forcibly merges two or more bug reports.  The first bug is chosen
     as the master bug, and its settings are assigned to the bugs listed
     next in the command.  See the text above for a description of what
     merging means.

     Note that this makes it possible to close bugs by merging; you are
     responsible for notifying submitters with an appropriate close
     message if you do this.

'unmerge bugnumber'
     Disconnects a bug report from any other reports with which it may
     have been merged.  If the report listed is merged with several
     others then they are all left merged with each other; only their
     associations with the bug explicitly named are removed.

     If many bug reports are merged and you wish to split them into two
     separate groups of merged reports you must unmerge each report in
     one of the new groups separately and then merge them into the
     required new group.

     You can only unmerge one report with each unmerge command; if you
     want to disconnect more than one bug simply include several unmerge
     commands in your message.

'tags bugnumber [ + | - | = ] tag [ tag ... ]'
     Sets tags for the bug report #bugnumber.  No notification is sent
     to the user who reported the bug.  Setting the action to + means to
     add each given tag, - means to remove each given tag, and = means
     to ignore the current tags and set them afresh to the list
     provided.  The default action is adding.

     Example usage:

          # same as 'tags 123456 + patch'
          tags 123456 patch

          # same as 'tags 123456 + help security'
          tags 123456 help security

          # add 'fixed' and 'pending' tags
          tags 123456 + fixed pending

          # remove 'unreproducible' tag
          tags 123456 - unreproducible

          # set tags to exactly 'moreinfo' and 'unreproducible'
          tags 123456 = moreinfo unreproducible

     Available tags currently include patch, wontfix, moreinfo,
     unreproducible, help, pending, fixed, security, notabug and easy.

     For their meanings please consult the general developers'
     documentation for the bug system.

'block bugnumber by bug [ bug ... ]'
'unblock bugnumber by bug [ bug ... ]'
     Use to note that one bug blocks another bug from being fixed.  The
     first listed bug is the one being blocked, and it is followed by
     the bug or bugs that are blocking it.  Use unblock to unblock a
     bug.

     Example usage:

          # indicates that 7890 cannot be fixed until 123456 is fixed
          block 7890 by 123456
          # indicates that 7890 can be fixed before 123456 after all
          unblock 7890 by 123456

'close bugnumber [ fixed-version ] (deprecated)'
     Close bug report #bugnumber.

     A notification is sent to the user who reported the bug, but (in
     contrast to mailing bugnumber-done) the text of the mail which
     caused the bug to be closed is not included in that notification.
     The maintainer who closes a report should ensure, probably by
     sending a separate message, that the user who reported the bug
     knows why it is being closed.  The use of this command is therefore
     deprecated.

     If you supply a fixed-version, the bug tracking system will note
     that the bug was fixed in that version of the package.

'package [ packagename ... ]'
     Limits the following commands so that they will only apply to bugs
     filed against the listed packages.  You can list one or more
     packages.  If you don't list any packages, the following commands
     will apply to all bugs.  You're encouraged to use this as a safety
     feature in case you accidentally use the wrong bug numbers.

     Example usage:

          package foo
          reassign 123456 bar 1.0-1

          package bar
          retitle 123456 bar: bar sucks
          severity 123456 normal

          package
          severity 234567 wishlist

'owner bugnumber address | !'
     Sets address to be the "owner" of #bugnumber.  The owner of a bug
     claims responsibility for fixing it.  This is useful to share out
     work in cases where a package has a team of maintainers.

     If you wish to become the owner of the bug yourself, you can use
     the !  shorthand or specify your own email address.

'noowner bugnumber'
     Forgets any idea that the bug has an owner other than the usual
     maintainer.  If the bug had no owner recorded then this will do
     nothing.

'archive bugnumber'
     Archives a bug that was previously archived if the bug fulfills the
     requirements for archival, ignoring time.

'unarchive bugnumber'
     Unarchives a bug that was previously archived.  Unarchival should
     generally be coupled with reopen and found/fixed as approprite.
     Bugs that have been unarchived can be archived using archive
     assuming the non-time based archival requirements are met.

'#...'
     One-line comment.  The # must be at the start of the line.  The
     text of comments will be included in the acknowledgement sent to
     the sender and to affected maintainers, so you can use this to
     document the reasons for your commands.

'quit'
'stop'
'thank'
'thanks'
'thankyou'
'thank you'
'--'
     On a line by itself, in any case, possibly followed by whitespace,
     tells the control server to stop processing the message; the
     remainder of the message can include explanations, signatures or
     anything else, none of it will be detected by the control server.
