;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The `ef-themes' are a collection of light and dark themes for GNU
;; Emacs whose goal is to provide colorful ("pretty") yet legible
;; options for users who want something with a bit more flair than the
;; `modus-themes' (also designed by me).

;;; Code:



(eval-and-compile
  (require 'ef-themes)

  ;; Most of the colors here, like the red and green hues, are defined
  ;; simply to preserve compatibility with the rest of the project.  We
  ;; don't actually rely on them for anything critical.
