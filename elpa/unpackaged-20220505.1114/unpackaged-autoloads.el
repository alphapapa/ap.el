(autoload 'unpackaged/font-compare "unpackaged" "\
Compare TEXT displayed in FONTS.
If TEXT is nil, use `lorem-ipsum' text.  FONTS is a list of font
family strings and/or font specs.

Interactively, prompt for TEXT, using `lorem-ipsum' if left
empty, and select FONTS with `x-select-font', pressing Cancel to
stop selecting fonts.

(autoload 'unpackaged/ibuffer-toggle-all-filter-groups "unpackaged" "\
Toggle all filter groups.
With prefix, toggle `ibuffer-show-empty-filter-groups'.

(autoload 'unpackaged/customize-theme-faces "unpackaged" "\
Customize THEME with FACES.

THEME is enabled.  If THEME is already enabled, also applies

(autoload 'unpackaged/lorem-ipsum-overlay "unpackaged" "\
Overlay all text in current buffer with \"lorem ipsum\" text.
When called again, remove overlays.  Useful for taking
screenshots without revealing buffer contents.

If REPLACE-P is non-nil (interactively, with prefix), replace
buffer contents rather than overlaying them.  When a buffer is
very large and would have so many overlays that performance would
be prohibitively slow, you may replace the buffer contents
instead.  (Of course, be careful about saving the buffer after
replacing its contents.)

Each piece of non-whitespace text in the buffer is compared with
regexps in `unpackaged/lorem-ipsum-overlay-exclude', and ones
that match are not overlaid.  Note that the regexps are compared
against the entire non-whitespace token, up-to and including the
preceding whitespace, but only the alphabetic part of the token
is overlaid.  For example, in an Org buffer, a line that starts
with:

  #+TITLE: unpackaged.el

could be matched against the exclude regexp (in `rx' syntax):

  (rx (or bol bos blank) \"#+\" (1+ alnum) \":\" (or eol eos blank))

And the line would be overlaid like:

  #+TITLE: parturient.et

(autoload 'unpackaged/org-table-face-mode "unpackaged" "\
Apply `org-table' face family to all text in Org tables.
Useful for forcibly applying the face to portions of table data
that might have a different face, which could affect alignment.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Unpackaged/Org-Table-Face mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is
positive, enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable
the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `unpackaged/org-table-face-mode'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.
