# Fontaine

Fontaine allows the user to define detailed font configurations and set
them on demand.  For example, one can have a `regular-editing` preset
and another for `presentation-mode` (these are arbitrary, user-defined
symbols): the former uses small fonts which are optimised for writing,
while the latter applies typefaces that are pleasant to read at
comfortable point sizes.
