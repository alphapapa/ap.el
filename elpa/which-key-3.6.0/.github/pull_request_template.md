Pull requests are welcome as long as the following apply. 

1. The issue you are fixing or feature you are adding is clearly described and/or referenced in the pull request or github issue. 
2. Since which-key is on [GNU ELPA](https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/), any [legally significant](https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Legally-Significant.html#Legally-Significant) changes must have their copyright assigned to the FSF ([more info](https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Copyright-Papers.html)). If you have not done so and would like to assign copyright, please see the [request form](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gnulib.git/tree/doc/Copyright/request-assign.future). This process is easy, but can be slow.
