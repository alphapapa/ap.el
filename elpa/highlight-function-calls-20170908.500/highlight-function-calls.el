;;; highlight-function-calls.el --- Highlight function/macro calls  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Adam Porter <adam@alphapapa.net>
;; Url: http://github.com/alphapapa/highlight-function-calls
;; Package-Version: 20170908.500
;; Version: 0.1-pre
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.4"))
;; Keywords: faces, highlighting

;;; Commentary:

;; This package highlights function symbols in function calls.  This
;; makes them stand out from other symbols, which makes it easy to see
;; where calls to other functions are.  Optionally, macros and special
;; forms can be highlighted as well.  Also, a list of symbols can be
;; excluded from highlighting; by default, ones like +/-, </>, error,
;; require, etc. are excluded.  Finally, the `not' function can be
;; highlighted specially.

;; Just run `highlight-function-calls-mode' to activate, or you can
;; add that to your `emacs-lisp-mode-hook' to do it automatically.

     ;; FIXME: This does not avoid matching opening parens in quoted
     ;; lists. I don't know if we can fix this, because `syntax-ppss'
     ;; doesn't give any information about this.  It might require
     ;; using semantic, which we probably don't want to mess with.
