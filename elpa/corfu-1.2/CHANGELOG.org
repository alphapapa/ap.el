* Version 1.2 (2024-01-23)

- Support the EXWM window manager.
- Optimization: Reduce auto completion timer overhead.
- Use ~internal-border-width~ instead of ~child-frame-border-width~.
- Internal refactoring: Do not use buffer-local variables.
- Internal refactoring: Store ~completion-extra-properties~ as part of
  ~completion-in-region--data~.

* Version 1.1 (2023-12-27)

- Deduplicate candidates with respect to ~equal-including-properties~, such that
  backends can provide equal candidate strings, which only differ in their text
  properties and annotations.
- Ensure that the string passed to the ~:exit-function~ retains the candidate
  properties, when possible. The properties are guaranteed to exist when a
  candidate is selected explicitly, but may be missing when candidates are
  completed in a stepwise manner.
- ~corfu-on-exact-match~: Add value ~show~ to the customization option. With this
  setting the Corfu popup will be shown even if there is only a single matching
  candidate.

* Version 1.0 (2023-12-01)

- Bug fixes.
- =corfu-quick=: Use a slightly different scheme to support more candidates.

* Version 0.37 (2023-07-02)
