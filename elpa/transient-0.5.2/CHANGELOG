* v0.5.2    2023-12-05

- Fixed formatting issues in the manual.

* v0.5.1    2023-12-05

- Added a new introduction by JD Smith (@jdtsmith).

Bug fixes:

- Faces that use a box are now defined more defensively to protect
  against unexpected values and provide reasonable fallback colors.
  413310cd, b8aefce3

- Only prepare to return to the parent transient if there actually is
  a parent.  The only negative effect of failing to do this was that
  the suffix was colored wrong, since ~transient--do-return~ falls back
  to behave like ~transient--do-exit~.  5f2cfc9f

* v0.5.0    2023-11-28

- Some suffix commands exit the transient from which they were
  invoked, while others don't (allowing the user to invoke another
  suffix without first having to enter the transient again).

  Until now it wasn't possible to tell which category any given suffix
  falls into, at least not by default.  Now the key binding of each
  suffix is colorized to indicate its transient behavior.  Red means
  that the suffix exits the transient, and blue means that it does
  not.  Keys for suffixes that currently cannot be invoked are gray.

  Likewise, the thin line, that is drawn between the transient popup
  buffer and the minibuffer, is used to indicate what happens, if you
  invoke a command that is not a suffix.  Most prefixes do not allow
  non-suffixes to be invoked, so this line usually is gray.  c8a9ac51

- Many faces have also been improved.  This involves changing which
  built-in faces they inherit from, some explicit changes to their
  appearance, and semantic clarifications.  Of course your mileage may
  vary â€” it's possible that some face just happened to look right with
  your chosen theme, but now it has to be themed to achieve that
  again.  47d3f01d 71d16d86 et al.

- Added a new face, ~transient-delimiter~, which is used for parentheses
  around values and the pipe character used to separate possible values
  from each other.  567b5d54

- Added a new command ~transient-toggle-level-limit~, bound to ~C-x a~,
  which temporarily shows all suffix commands a transient has to
  offer.  This makes it possible to occasionally use more obscure
  commands and arguments, without having to always display them.
  For more information see [[https://magit.vc/manual/transient/Enabling-and-Disabling-Suffixes.html][Enabling and Disabling Suffixes]].  #243

The changes described below, only directly affect package authors and
users who implement their own transients.  If that does not describe
you, then all you have to know is that many features were fine-tuned
and otherwise improved, opening up some new use-cases and making some
things easier to implement.  This will hopefully lead to improvements
in your favorite transient-using packages in the coming months.

- It sometimes makes sense to bind multiple keys to the same suffix
  command, e.g., because they behave differently based on the suffix
  description, or some other slot that can be set per binding.
  Previously these bindings shared a visibility level; how this can
  be set individually.  #153

- While functions are run, which format strings to be inserted into the
  transient buffer or to determine whether other aspects of a suffix,
  that transient buffer no longer is the current buffer.  Instead the
  buffer in which the prefix and its suffixes operate, is the current
  buffer.  This affects functions such as ~transient-format-description~
  and those found in predicate slots such as ~if~.  In contexts where
  the transient buffer is needed but the other buffer happens to be
  current, the new macro ~transient-with-shadowed-buffer~ can be used
  to temporarily change that.

- The new suffix slots ~face~ and ~inapt-face~ can be used to specify how
  a suffix looks, which in simple cases is more convenient than using
  a function as ~description~ and adding the face there.  The values of
  these slots should be faces or functions that returns a face.  The
  default for ~inapt-face~ is ~transient-inapt-suffix~, but in some cases
  it is undesirable to apply this face to the whole description, so
  this can be overridden by setting this slot to ~nil~ for individual
  suffixes.  The default for ~face~ is ~nil~.  c2a75880 8e15a29b 71399d21

- Added new variables ~transient--pending-suffix~ and
  ~transient--pending-group~, which are bound while a suffix/group is
  being inserted.  These are mostly intended for internal purposes,
  but in some rare complex cases package authors might need them too.
  0717589a 70e8dc80

- Sometimes it is useful to display some information in the transient
  buffer, which is not associated with a suffix command.  The new
  class ~transient-info~ can be used for that purpose.  Children that
  use this class are very similar to regular suffixes, the lack of a
  command binding being nearly the only difference.  #226

- Instead of a list of choices, the value of a suffix's ~choices~ slot
  can now be a function that returns such a list.  #212

- Per-suffix functions that format its description (specified using the
  ~descripton~ slot) can now optionally take one instead of zero argument,
  the respective suffix object.  09be367b

- Added a new command ~transient-echo-arguments~ intended for use in
  examples and bug reports, when a prefix must bind some command, but it
  does not really matter which.  Using this command is less verbose than
  having to implement a dummy every time, and it comes with some goodies.
  I.e., it reports information about the prefix from which it was invoked.
  faa3d09d

- When a command was defined using ~transient-define-suffix~ and an alias
  for that command was created using ~defalias~, then the alias had no
  access to the associated suffix object.  Now it does, which makes it
  possible to bind the same command multiple times in a prefix, and make
  it behave differently depending on the symbol-name that was used to
  invoke it.  f43aee1a

- The values of a prefix's ~transient-suffix~ and ~transient-non-suffix~
  slots should now be a boolean.  The value of the ~transient-suffix~
  slot has to be handled differently for different types of suffixes.
  I.e., infix arguments must ignore it, and sub-prefixes must honor
  it but to do so they must use a different pre-command.  Previously
  booleans were not supported and the previously recommended values,
  ~transient--do-stay~ and ~transient--do-exit~ are still supported (but
  they are "corrected" for sub-prefixes).  For the ~transient~ slot the
  use of booleans was always allowed and recommended.  8098d175

- For sub-prefixes a value of ~t~ for the ~transient-suffix~ slot of the
  parent prefix now means that suffixes, which exit the sub-prefix,
  return to the parent prefix, instead of exiting that as well.
  784887b7 5ad5b627

- In addition to booleans and pre-commands, the values of the
  ~transient-suffix~, ~transient-non-suffix~ and ~transient~ slots
  may now also be pre-command "shorthands", e.g., use ~leave~ instead
  of ~transient--do-leave~ (which in some cases is a good value for
  `transient-non-suffix`). 9617b6c7

- ~transient--do-replace~ now behaves as documented and implied by its
  name.  Use the new ~transient--do-stack~ if you want to return to the
  outer prefix.  94661e0c

- Added a new prefix slot ~transient-switch-frame~, which allows
  specifying the transient behavior of ~switch-frame~ per prefix and
  independently of the transient behavior of other non-suffixes
  (specified using the ~transient-non-suffix~ slot).  609dabfd

- Added a new function ~transient-prefix-object~ to allow package
  authors to avoid the following unfortunate complication.

  While a transient is being setup or refreshed (which involves
  preparing its suffixes) the variable ~transient--prefix~ can be
  used to access the prefix object.  Thus this is what has to be
  used in suffix methods such as ~transient-format-description~,
  and in object-specific functions that are stored in suffix slots
  such as ~description~.  When a suffix command is invoked (i.e.,
  in its ~interactive~ form and function body) then the variable
  ~transient-current-prefix~ has to be used instead.

  Two distinct variables are needed, because any prefix may itself
  be used as a suffix of another prefix, and such sub-prefixes have
  to be able to tell themselves apart from the prefix they were
  invoked from.  Regular suffix commands, which are not prefixes, do
  not have to concern themselves with this distinction, so they can
  use this function instead.  In the context of a plain suffix, it
  always returns the value of the appropriate variable.

This release drops support for Emacs 25.  The last Emacs 25 release
(25.3) was released in 2017; over six years ago.  The current Emacs
version is 29.1; that's four major releases since 25.1.

* v0.4.3    2023-08-25

- Added a second implementation of ~transient--wrap-command~, taking
  advantage of improvements in Emacs 30.

* v0.4.2    2023-08-25

- Infix commands are only useful when invoked from a transient prefix
  command and ~execute-extended-command~ should not offer them as
  completion candidates.  In the past we used a weird kludge to
  accomplish that, but now we rely on ~read-extended-command-predicate~.
  That allowed the removal of some complications and made it possible
  to fix a bug in ~transient--wrap-command~.

  To hide infix commands, users now have to update to Emacs 28, or
  later, and customize ~read-extended-command-predicate~.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq read-extended-command-predicate
          'command-completion-default-include-p)
  #+end_src

- Due to changes in Emacs 29.1, pretty-printing isn't consistent
  across Emacs releases anymore by default, which is unfortunate
  in our case because we use it to write to files that are likely
  to be checked into version control.  We now force the use of the
  old style across releases.

* v0.4.1    2023-06-02

Bug fixes:

- 070d47b0 Support searches that end right after suffix
- ab831828 transient--insert-group(columns): Drop separator before first column
- 62edeffd #247 Fix bug using :incompatible using suffixes before infixes
- 6efa9fad transient-predicate-map: Bind univeral-argument-more

* v0.4.0    2023-05-10

- Transient has to update state after every suffix command.  If that
  fails for some reason, then Emacs ends up in an badly broken state.
  It was rare, but in the worst case scenario, that meant that Emacs
  refused to call any more commands and had to be killed.

  Naturally ~post-command-hook~ is the first choice to run something
  after commands, but unfortunately that hook is not guaranteed to run
  only once, and worse it is not guaranteed run /after/ the command.
  Working around this limitation made an essential part of Transient
  much more complex and fragile.  As new edge-cases were discovered,
  new and increasingly desperate heuristics had to be added, until I
  finally decided that relying solely on hooks was just not feasible.

  Now ~pre-command-hook~ is used to advice ~this-command~, to add an
  around advice, which ensures that the state update takes place, even
  when ~post-command-hook~ is run prematurely.  The advice wraps both
  the function body and the interactive spec with ~unwind-protect~, so
  we can finally be sure that the state change is always performed,
  and that the advice is removed again.

  It has been an interesting journey, and I have documented it in long
  commit messages.  If you are interested in the details, see 7b8a7d71
  (which still tries to avoid using any advice), 51c68c87, 52cac9c0,
  bug#61179 and bug#61176.

- The ~transient-define-prefix~ now expands to code instead of data,
  meaning that lambda expressions are finally properly evaluated and
  byte-compiled.  ea851f3b e88f51d6 277e5f2d a1774182

- Popup navigation is no longer considered a second-class feature and
  is enabled by default.  Some transients allow arbitrary non-suffixes
  to be invoked, so some key bindings, which were previously used for
  popup navigation, had to be removed, to avoid conflicts.  98d50202 ff

- Each prefix and suffix can now have its own help function.  This is
  configured using the new ~show-help~ slot.  ea5ac99f

- The ~transient-options~ class now supports two types of options that
  can have multiple values: repeated option-value pairs and a final
  option that takes all remaining arguments as value.  #154

- Added support for the use of non-proportional text in the transient
  popup.  7f5520b3

- Imenu was taught about Transient's definition macros.  #178

- It is now possible to return to the parent prefix from a sub-prefix.
  e90f7a16

- Boolean values of the ~transient~ slot of sub-prefixes are now
  interpreted correctly.  4a36b1d9

- Added new option ~transient-hide-during-minibuffer-read~.  5762bd9a

- Added new option ~transient-align-variable-pitch~.  cda6a120

- Added new command ~transient-reset~, which clears the set and saved
  value of the active transient.  51585b8d

- When using Emacs 28, ~execute-extended-command~ can be told to ignore
  transient infix commands.  Even when using that Emacs version, that
  command does not ignore any commands by default, but this behavior
  can be easily be enabled using:

    (setq read-extended-command-predicate
          'command-completion-default-include-p)

  Infix arguments are implemented as commands, so they by default show
  up as completion candidates of ~execute-extended-command~, which is
  useless because they are only intended to be invoked from transient
  prefix commands.  Enable this feature to prevent that.

- Added new command ~transient-toggle-debug~.  b466cd9a

- Depend on the Compat package, allowing me to use convenient features
  that were added to Emacs over the last few years, without having to
  wait another few years until everybody has updated to a reasonably
  recent Emacs release.  5ae3c401

- Added basic support for suffixes that span multiple lines (multi-row
  cells).  #193

- Infix arguments can now be invoked following a prefix argument.  To
  use a negative prefix argument use "C--".  "-" cannot be used anymore
  because it conflicts with the most common prefix key used for infix
  arguments.  ed2febd0

- Removed obsolete aliases for functions deprecated in v0.3.0.  #192

- Duplicated suffix commands are now disambiguated, making it possible
  to bind a command multiple times as a suffix of a transient command,
  but still have it do different things depending on what binding is
  used, based on the value of some slot of the corresponding suffix
  object, similar to how ~self-insert-command~ inserts the pressed key.
  f27c840a

- ~recursive-edit~ and ~top-level~ can now be used while a transient is
  active.  fcdeadc1 5a1b2bac

- Switched to Emacs 29's new keymap functions, which are also supported
  in newer releases, thanks to the Compat package.  87f70af5 5a966aa8

* v0.3.7    2021-10-25

- Added an additional safety hatch to prevent Emacs from entering an
  inconsistent state when an unexpected error occurs.  99e48369

- Added support for implementing section movement commands in
  third-party packages.  This was requested by the maintainer of
  Emacspeak.  Because they would be of very limited use to sighted
  users no such commands are added to Transient itself.  769219b5

- ~transient-read-number-{N0,N+,N}~ now support infix arguments that
  have three different states: disabled, enabled without an empty
  value, and enabled with a non-empty value.  626d105e

- If a command is called as a suffix of itself, then the help command
  shows the function definition instead of the man-page as it usually
  does for prefixes.  e17e2b2f

- Give users more control over how the transient buffer is displayed.
  Various aspects that were previously hardcoded can now be changed
  using the ~transient-display-buffer-action~ option.  7c677737

- Added support for adding suffixes that might be neither defined nor
  autoloaded when the prefix is invoked.  This usually results in an
  error and while it is now possible to override that using an extra
  step, it is still discouraged.  6842305e

Bug fixes:

- 1e740608 transient-map: Bind C-u to universal-argument

- 0c2255a2 transient-get-value: Add an emergency exit

Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.

* v0.3.6    2021-07-01

- Added new option ~transient-force-single-column~, which may be useful
  for low vision.  #122

- Added new option ~transient-highlight-higher-levels~, which is
  intended for package authors.  90a05622

* v0.3.5    2021-06-16

- Added a kludge to work around some unexpected Emacs behavior.
  ef921d30

- When showing help for a suffix that is also a subprefix, then also
  consider the manpage that is set for the prefix, if any.  a9bdd013

* v0.3.4    2021-05-25

- Very minor changes.

* v0.3.3    2021-05-24

- Added SPDX-License-Identifier library header.  7d3d8d79

* v0.3.2    2021-04-20

- Fixed an error message.  c145229a

* v0.3.1    2021-04-19

- Changed ~transient-prefix~'s ~suffix-description~ slot to be initially
  unbound, as was always intended.  c28b8a4

- Added new functions ~transient-read-file~ and
  ~transient-read-existing-file~.  a3b44224

* v0.3.0    2021-02-21

- Added a temporary kludge to prevent a transient from being invoked
  while the minibuffer is active.  A future release will enable
  this again, once we are sure that cannot cause Emacs to enter an
  inconsistent state, that causes most events to be ignored.  #112

- Improved the backtrace that is shown when a fatal error occurred in a
  critical context.  This involved some back and forth.  See commits
  mentioning the "emergency exit".

- Added support for defining a per-prefix fallback suffix description
  function, which is used for suffixes that do not explicitly provide
  a description.  The new ~suffix-description~ slot is used to specify
  that function.  The new ~transient-command-summary-or-name~ function
  is useful, not just as an example.  8b22b52b

- Added ~transient-arg-value~, which can be used to extract the values
  of individual arguments in the output of ~transient-args~.  d76f73f8

- Added support for using variables in group and suffix definitions
  of a prefix.  Such indirect specifications are resolved when the
  transient prefix is being defined.  #101

- No longer bind ~M-<key>~ to any common suffix commands; freeing this
  namespace for a variety of uses in individual transient.  A few
  existing bindings had to be changed because of this.  990eb0a2

- Added ~transient-suffixes~ function, which is useful when
  ~transient-args~ is not sufficient because one needs the suffix
  objects, not just their values.  #98

- Added ~init-value~ slot for infix and prefix objects.  If this value
  bound then it is called with the object as only argument instead of
  the primary ~transient-init-value~ method of the object class.  #96,
  3284f6a0

- Added ~unsavable~ slot for infix objects.  If this is non-nil, then
  the value of the infix is removed from the prefix value before
  saving, setting and adding to history.  #96

- Added support for right padding the keys of all suffixes in a group.
  This is controlled using the new ~pad-keys~ slot of group objects.
  7502390b, 293a437d

- Added support for delaying setup of the suffixes of a prefix until
  that is invoked.  Also added support for using unnamed functions as
  suffix commands.  Taken together these changes make it possible to
  dynamically create the list of suffixed.  See the ~notmuch-transient~
  package for two examples: ~notmuch-search-transient~ and
  ~notmuch-tag-transient~.  f2252d53, a3e53633

- Added the infix class ~transient-lisp-variable~.  2d8ceff4

- Added ~transient-infix-read~, which allows arbitrary commands to read
  a value the same way as would the infix command that is provided as
  an argument to this function.  73694be4

- Added support for coloring suffixes in a Hydra-like fashion.
  To enable this, customize option ~transient-semantic-coloring~.
  248862c5

- Added support for disabling and dimming suffix commands that are
  currently not suitable, instead of completely hidding them.  #80

- Autoload functions that serve a purpose similar to that of
  ~define-key~. #85

- Consistently use ~transient-~ as the prefix of all symbols.
  The old names remain available as obsolete aliases.  dd0c44cb

- Added support for scrolling the transient popup buffer using the
  scroll bar.  #84

- Various bug fixes.

* v0.2.0    2020-02-26

- ~transient-args~ must now be called with a transient prefix command
  as argument.  It is now the only argument and its value must be a
  symbol now, an object is no longer supported.  When this command
  does not match ~current-transient-command~, then this function now
  returns the set, saved or default value.  0312b93, 7d0db28,
  d33fe5a, a6ce195

- No longer use the last history element as initial minibuffer input
  by default.  Added new option ~transient-read-with-initial-input~ to
  allow users to restore the old default. dcf7a4d, 5decc6e

- The set and saved values were not always used.  #68

- Added support for inserting and removing groups.  #36

- Added support for specifying where to insert elements and groups
  using coordinates.  #26

- Added support for moving the cursor inside the transient popup
  buffer using the arrow keys or Isearch, and for invoke suffix
  commands using RET or mouse clicks.  Unlike Magit-Popup, Transient
  doesn't make the transient popup buffer the current buffer.  This
  is important when invoking suffix commands that take the current
  position into account, but it has the drawback that we do not get
  these features for free.  Because I also consider them unnecessary
  I did not implement them initially.  Turns out quite a few users
  strongly disagree.  Set ~transient-enable-popup-navigation~ to ~t~ to
  enable these features.  #42

- Explicitly support Edebug.  Previously when Edebug was triggered
  while a transient was active, then Emacs entered an unrecoverable
  state.  #19

- No longer attempt to display a thin line in termcap frames.  0a96a57

- Work around some Ivy bugs/incompatibilities.  af243d5, fed7ab1

- The new option ~transient-force-fixed-pitch~ allows users to use a
  monospaced font in transient's popup buffer even if they use a
  proportional font for the rest of Emacs.  #25, #67

- Adapted to backward incompatible changes in Emacs 27 that prevented
  faces from extending to the edge of the window as expected.  c1ae1ee

- No longer depend on dash (or any other third-party package).  #66

- When a transient has conflicting key bindings and Transient is
  configure to warn about that, then Emacs entered an unrecoverable
  state instead.  75de1f0

- ~transient-format-value~ now supports options with multiple values.
  #65

- Removing a suffix based on its position was broken.  41cbf49

- In our popup buffers disable the tab feature that Emacs 27
  introduces.  #62

- Inserting a new suffix next to another ended up replacing the latter
  instead if its key binding was defined in the suffix object.  #58

- ~transient-undefined~ learned to make some noise.  #57

- Fix replacing a suffix with another suffix bound to the same key.
  5a360bb, 4ce1868

- Characters are no longer allowed as pseudo suffixes.  To insert a
  an empty cell into a table use the empty string instead.  71687ba

- Added new variable ~transient--buffer-name~.  #45

- Some misconfiguration that affects how the transient popup buffer
  is displayed could lead to Emacs entering an unrecoverable state.
  #34, #44

- The echo area is now cleared when the transient popup buffer is
  shown.  afdf1f0

- If ~transient-show-popup~ is 0 or a negative number, then not even
  a one-line summary is shown initially.  #41

- Added new function ~transient-read-directory~.  a87cb2c

- ~define-transient-command~ now supports specifying the level of a
  suffix using the ~:level~ keyword argument.  6506cfd

- The mode-related suffix predicates now also support a list of modes
  as argument in addition to a single mode as before.  1c6afb8

- The new ~incompatible~ slot of prefix objects makes it possible to
  specify which arguments should be autoatically disabled when the
  user enables certain other arguments.  544b3bb

- ~transient--history-push~ is now defined as generic function.  47b7975

- The a new ~history-key~ slot and ~transient--history-key~ generic
  function for prefix objects.  3668aeb, e627d45

- Disallow setting the level of essential suffixes that are shared
  between all transients.  #29

- The active infix is now highlight while reading its value from the
  user.  #30

- The commands ~transient-set~  and ~transient-save~ can now be configured
  to exit the transient, though by default they still don't.  a47ae94

- Always respect the ~transient~ slot of a suffix, even if that suffix
  has a binding in ~transient-predicate-map~.  919fc66

- Added new generic functions ~transient-set-value~ and
  ~transient-save-value~ intended for prefix commands.  ebe9d9d

- It is no longer possible to set a prefix level to 0, which is an
  invalid value.  #28

- All transient prefix and suffix commands are now automatically
  declared to be for interactive use only.  a6295fa

- Infix arguments are no longer added to ~command-history~ because
  these entries were both useless and extremely noisy.  #23

- ~digit-argument~ no longer exits the transient.  5f0ec7d

- A new keymap, ~transient-base-map~ was added to make it easier to
  change key bindings that are shared between all transients.  This
  new keymap is used as the parent of all the other keymaps that are
  shared between all transients.

- Added new commands ~transient-scroll-up~ and ~transient-scroll-down~,
  which scroll the transient window.  ~C-v~ and ~M-v~ (and ~<next>~ and
  ~<prior>~) are bound to these commands.  These keys were chosen they
  are bound to scrolling commands in the global map too.  This made
  it necessary to find a new binding for ~transient-show~, which ~C-t~ is
  bound to now.  #17

- The new option ~transient-mode-line-format~ allows users to use
  a mode-line for the transient popup buffer instead of just a
  thin line that separates it from the echo area.  When using a
  non-standard value for ~transient-display-buffer-action~ it may
  be necessary to do that.  #17

- The new option ~transient-display-buffer-action~ allows users to
  specify how a window is selected to display the transient popup
  buffer.  The ~lv~ library is no longer used.  #17

- The window that was selected before the transient window was shown
  is no longer re-selected before calling a suffix that exits the
  transient.  If a suffix changes the selected window unintentionally,
  then that is a bug.  This makes it possible to intentionally change
  the window layout using transients.

- An infix is a special kind of suffix.  Depending on context
  "suffixes" means "suffixes (including infixes)" or "non-infix
  suffixes".  This is now mention in a few places where users might
  otherwise get confused.

- Stopped claiming that the transient is shown in the "echo area",
  because technically that is not correct.  Instead talk about the
  "popup buffer".

- Fixed handling of suffix commands that are undefined at the time the
  prefix is invoked.  This is still an error, but the error message
  now explains what is wrong.  a729bbb

- Fixed saving values/history/levels, making sure that the printed
  expression is never abbreviated.  #15

- Fixed jumping to the correct place in a manpage when showing the
  documentation for an infix argument.  c4bf4af

- Bound ~ESC ESC ESC~ to ~transient-quit-all~ because the convention is
  that it should be possible to exit any temporary state using this
  binding.  #12

- Fixed referencing suffix bindings by their key when the key binding
  is defined in the suffix object instead of in the suffix spec.
  e4ffb97

- Remove trailing whitespace from popup text for the benefit of users
  who have set enabled ~show-trailing-whitespace~ globally.  0758efa

- Fixed showing available bindings on a single line instead of using
  the usual popup buffer.  2f011c9, 99d3bf6

- Added a line between the ~lv~ window and the echo area.  ca18bb6

- Fixed adding a new suffix at the end of a group and removing a
  group's last suffix.  #20, #6

- No longer use ~cl-typep~, which appears to have a bug on Emacs 25.
  9183fe1

- Fixed ~lisp~ make target.  170a3fd

- Fixed reading a number as the value of an infix.  8219c0b

- Various bug fixes to
  ~transient--goto-argument-description~ (4f80a89),
  ~transient-show-help~ (ccac95e),
  ~transient-infix-read~ (7bf9759).

* v0.1.0    2019-01-14
