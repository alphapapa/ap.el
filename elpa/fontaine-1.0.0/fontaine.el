;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Fontaine lets the user specify presets of font configurations and set
;; them on demand on graphical Emacs frames.  The user option
;; `fontaine-presets' holds all such presets.
;;
;; Presets consist of a list of properties that govern the family, weight,
;; and height of the faces `default', `fixed-pitch', `variable-pitch',
;; `bold', and `italic'.  Each preset is identified by a user-defined
;; symbol as the car of a property list.  It looks like this (check the
;; default value of `fontaine-presets' for how everything is pieced
;; together):
;;
;;     (regular
;;      :default-family "Hack"
;;      :default-weight normal
;;      :default-height 100
;;      :fixed-pitch-family "Fira Code"
;;      :fixed-pitch-weight nil ; falls back to :default-weight
;;      :fixed-pitch-height 1.0
;;      :variable-pitch-family "Noto Sans"
;;      :variable-pitch-weight normal
;;      :variable-pitch-height 1.0
;;      :bold-family nil ; use whatever the underlying face has
;;      :bold-weight bold
;;      :italic-family "Source Code Pro"
;;      :italic-slant italic
;;      :line-spacing 1)
;;
;; The doc string of `fontaine-presets' explains all properties in detail
;; and documents some important caveats or information about font settings
;; in Emacs.
;;
;; The command `fontaine-set-preset' applies the desired preset.  If there
;; is only one available, it implements it outright.  Otherwise it produces
;; a minibuffer prompt with completion among the available presets.  When
;; called from Lisp, the `fontaine-set-preset' requires a PRESET argument,
;; such as:
;;
;;     (fontaine-set-preset 'regular)
;;
;; The default behaviour of `fontaine-set-preset' is to change fonts across
;; all graphical frames.  The user can, however, limit the changes to a
;; given frame.  For interactive use, this is done by invoking the command
;; with a universal prefix argument (`C-u' by default), which changes fonts
;; only in the current frame.  When used in Lisp, the FRAME argument can be
;; a frame object (satisfies `framep') or a non-nil value: the former
;; applies the effects to the given object, while the latter means the
;; current frame and thus is the same as interactively supplying the prefix
;; argument.
;;
;; The command `fontaine-set-face-font' prompts with completion for a face
;; and then asks the user to specify the value of the relevant properties.
;; Preferred font families can be defined in the user option
;; `fontaine-font-families', otherwise Fontaine will try to find suitable
;; options among the fonts installed on the system (not always reliable,
;; depending on the Emacs build and environment it runs in).  The list of
;; faces to choose from is the same as that implied by the
;; `fontaine-presets'.  Properties to change and their respective values
;; will depend on the face.  For example, the `default' face requires a
;; natural number for its height attribute, whereas every other face needs
;; a floating point (understood as a multiple of the default height).  This
;; command is for interactive use only and is supposed to be used for
;; previewing certain styles before eventually codifying them as presets.
;;
;; Changing the `bold' and `italic' faces only has a noticeable effect if
;; the underlying theme does not hardcode a weight and slant but inherits
;; from those faces instead (e.g. the `modus-themes').
;;
;; The `fontaine-set-face-font' also accepts an optional FRAME argument,
;; which is the same as what was described above for `fontaine-set-preset'.
;;
;; The latest value of `fontaine-set-preset' is stored in a file whose
;; location is defined in `fontaine-latest-state-file' (normally part of
;; the `.emacs.d' directory).  Saving is done by the function
;; `fontaine-store-latest-preset', which should be assigned to a hook
;; (e.g. `kill-emacs-hook').  To restore that value, the user can call the
;; function `fontaine-restore-latest-preset' (such as by adding it to their
;; init file).
;;
;; For users of the `no-littering' package, `fontaine-latest-state-file' is
;; not stored in their `.emacs.d', but in a standard directory instead:
;; <https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering>.
;;
;; As for the name of this package, it is the French word for
;; "fountain" which, in turn, is what the font or source is.  However,
;; I will not blame you if you can only interpret it as a descriptive
;; backronym: Fonts, Ornaments, and Neat Typography Are Irrelevant in
;; Non-graphical Emacs.

  "Alist of desired typographic properties.

The car of each cell is an arbitrary symbol that identifies
and/or describes the set of properties (e.g. small, reading).

A preset whose car is t is treated as the default option.  This
makes it easier to specify multiple presets without duplicating
their properties.  The other presets beside t act as overrides of
the defaults and, as such, need only consist of the properties
that change from the default.  See the default value of this
variable for how that is done.

The cdr is a plist that specifies the typographic properties of
the faces `default', `fixed-pitch', `variable-pitch', `bold', and
`italic'.  It also covers the `line-spacing' variable.

The properties in detail:

- `:default-family' is the family of the `default' face.  If not
  specified, it falls back to Monospace.

- `:default-weight' is the weight of the `default' face.  The
  fallback value is `normal'.  Available weights are `normal' or
  `regular', `thin', `ultralight', `extralight', `light',
  `semilight', `medium', `semibold', `extrabold', `ultrabold' and
  must be supported by the underlying typeface.

- `:default-height' is the height of the `default' face.  The
  fallback value is 100 (the height is 10x the point size).

- `:fixed-pitch-family', `:fixed-pitch-weight',
  `:fixed-pitch-height' apply to the `fixed-pitch' face.  Their
  fallback values are `:default-family', `:default-weight', and
  1.0, respectively.

- `:fixed-pitch-serif-family', `:fixed-pitch-serif-weight',
  `:fixed-pitch-serif-height' apply to the `fixed-pitch-serif'
  face.  Their fallback values are `:default-family',
  `:default-weight', and 1.0, respectively.

- The `:variable-pitch-family', `:variable-pitch-weight', and
  `:variable-pitch-height' apply to the `variable-pitch' face.
  They all fall back to the respective default values, as
  described above.

- The `:bold-family' and `:italic-family' are the font families
  of the `bold' and `italic' faces, respectively.  Only set them
  if you want to override that of the underlying face.

- The `:bold-weight' specifies the weight of the `bold' face.
  Its fallback value is bold, meaning the weight, not the face.

- The `:italic-slant' specifies the slant of the `italic' face.
  Its fallback value is italic, in reference to the slant, not
  the face.  Acceptable values are `italic', `oblique', `normal',
  `reverse-italic', `reverse-oblique' and must be supported by
  the underlying typeface.

- The `:line-spacing' specifies the value of the `line-spacing'
  variable.

- The `:inherit' contains the name of another named preset.  This
  tells the relevant Fontaine functions to get the properties of
  that preset and blend them with those of the current one.  The
  properties of the current preset take precedence over those of
  the inherited one, thus overriding them.  In practice, this is
  a way to have something like an extra-large preset copy the
  large preset and then only modify its individual properties.
  Remember that all named presets fall back to the preset whose
  name is t: the `:inherit' is not a substitute for that generic
  fallback but rather an extra method of specifying font
  configuration presets.

Use the desired preset with the command `fontaine-set-preset'.

For detailed configuration: Info node `(fontaine) Shared and
implicit fallback values for presets'.

Caveats or further notes:

- On a Windows system, setting a `default' weight other than
  `regular' or `normal' will not work.  This is a limitation with
  Emacs on that system.

- All the properties for `bold' and `italic' will only have a
  noticeable effect if the active theme does not hardcode a
  weight and a slant, but instead inherits the relevant
  face (such as the `modus-themes').

- A height attribute for anything other than the `default' face
  must be set to a floating point, which is understood as a
  multiple of the default height (this allows all faces to scale
  harmoniously).  The `:default-height' always is a natural
  number.

- Fontaine does not [yet] support Emacs' fontsets for other
  scripts or character sets (e.g. Emoji).  Read the documentation
  in the Info node `(emacs) Modifying Fontsets'."

The value of `fontaine-current-preset' must be one of the keys in

Re-applying the current preset is useful when a new theme is
loaded which overrides certain font families.  For example, if
the theme defines the `bold' face without a `:family', loading
that theme will make `bold' use the `default' family, even if the
`fontaine-presets' are configured to have different families
between the two.  In such a case, applying the current preset at
the post `load-theme' phase (e.g. via a hook) ensures that font
configurations remain consistent.

Some themes that provide hooks of this sort are the
`modus-themes' and `ef-themes' (both by Protesilaos)."

When called interactively, prompt for FACE and then continue
prompting for the relevant face attributes each of which depends
on the FACE (for example, the `default' FACE accepts a family, a
height as a natural number, and a weight, whereas `bold' only
accepts a weight).

With regard to the font family that some faces accept, the
candidates are those specified in the user option
`fontaine-font-families'.  If none are specified, try to find
relevant installed fonts and provide them as completion
candidates.

Note that changing the `bold' and `italic' faces only has a
noticeable effect if the underlying does not hardcode a weight
and slant but inherits from those faces instead (e.g. the
`modus-themes').

When called from Lisp (albeit discouraged), if FACE is not part
of `fontaine--font-faces', fall back to interactively calling
`fontaine-set-preset'.

all frames.  If FRAME satisfies `framep', then make the changes
