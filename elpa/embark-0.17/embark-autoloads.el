Record command which opened the minibuffer.

(autoload 'embark-bindings-in-keymap "embark" "\
Explore command key bindings in KEYMAP with `completing-read'.
The selected command will be executed.  Interactively, prompt the
user for a KEYMAP variable.

\(fn KEYMAP)" t nil)

(autoload 'embark-bindings "embark" "\
Explore all current command key bindings with `completing-read'.
The selected command will be executed.

If NO-GLOBAL is non-nil (interactively, if called with a prefix
argument) omit global key bindings; this leaves key bindings from
minor mode maps and the local map (usually set by the major
mode), but also less common keymaps such as those from a text
property or overlay, or the overriding maps:
`overriding-terminal-local-map' and `overriding-local-map'.

\(fn NO-GLOBAL)" t nil)

(autoload 'embark-bindings-at-point "embark" "\
Explore all key bindings at point with `completing-read'.
The selected command will be executed.

This command lists key bindings found in keymaps specified by the
text properties `keymap' or `local-map', from either buffer text
or an overlay.  These are not widely used in Emacs, and when they
are used can be somewhat hard to discover.  Examples of locations
that have such a keymap are links and images in `eww' buffers,
attachment links in `gnus' article buffers, and the 'Stash' line
in a `vc-dir' buffer." t nil)

(autoload 'embark-prefix-help-command "embark" "\
Prompt for and run a command bound in the prefix used for this command.
The prefix described consists of all but the last event of the
key sequence that ran this command.  This function is intended to
be used as a value for `prefix-help-command'.

In addition to using completion to select a command, you can also
type @ and the key binding (without the prefix)." t nil)

(autoload 'embark-act "embark" "\
Prompt the user for an action and perform it.
The targets of the action are chosen by `embark-target-finders'.
By default, if called from a minibuffer the target is the top
completion candidate.  When called from a non-minibuffer buffer
there can multiple targets and you can cycle among them by using
`embark-cycle' (which is bound by default to the same key
binding `embark-act' is, but see `embark-cycle-key').

This command uses `embark-prompter' to ask the user to specify an
action, and calls it injecting the target at the first minibuffer
prompt.

If you call this from the minibuffer, it can optionally quit the
minibuffer.  The variable `embark-quit-after-action' controls
whether calling `embark-act' with nil ARG quits the minibuffer,
and if ARG is non-nil it will do the opposite.  Interactively,
ARG is the prefix argument.

If instead you call this from outside the minibuffer, the first
ARG targets are skipped over (if ARG is negative the skipping is
done by cycling backwards) and cycling starts from the following
target.

\(fn &optional ARG)" t nil)

(autoload 'embark-act-all "embark" "\
Prompt the user for an action and perform it on each candidate.
The candidates are chosen by `embark-candidate-collectors'.
By default, if called from a minibuffer the candidates are the
completion candidates.

This command uses `embark-prompter' to ask the user to specify an
action, and calls it injecting the target at the first minibuffer
prompt.

If you call this from the minibuffer, it can optionally quit the
minibuffer.  The variable `embark-quit-after-action' controls
whether calling `embark-act' with nil ARG quits the minibuffer,
and if ARG is non-nil it will do the opposite.  Interactively,
ARG is the prefix argument.

\(fn &optional ARG)" t nil)

(autoload 'embark-dwim "embark" "\
Run the default action on the current target.
The target of the action is chosen by `embark-target-finders'.

If the target comes from minibuffer completion, then the default
action is the command that opened the minibuffer in the first
place, unless overidden by `embark-default-action-overrides'.

For targets that do not come from minibuffer completion
\(typically some thing at point in a regular buffer) and whose
type is not listed in `embark-default-action-overrides', the
default action is given by whatever binding RET has in the action
keymap for the target's type.

See `embark-act' for the meaning of the prefix ARG.

\(fn &optional ARG)" t nil)

(autoload 'embark-become "embark" "\
Make current command become a different command.
Take the current minibuffer input as initial input for new
command.  The new command can be run normally using key bindings or
\\[execute-extended-command], but if the current command is found in a keymap in
`embark-become-keymaps', that keymap is activated to provide
convenient access to the other commands in it.

If FULL is non-nil (interactively, if called with a prefix
argument), the entire minibuffer contents are used as the initial
input of the new command.  By default only the part of the
minibuffer contents between the current completion boundaries is
taken.  What this means is fairly technical, but (1) usually
there is no difference: the completion boundaries include the
entire minibuffer contents, and (2) the most common case where
these notions differ is file completion, in which case the
completion boundaries single out the path component containing
point.

\(fn &optional FULL)" t nil)

(autoload 'embark-collect "embark" "\
Create an Embark Collect buffer.

To control the display, add an entry to `display-buffer-alist'
with key \"Embark Collect\".

Reverting an Embark Collect buffer has slightly unusual behavior
if the buffer was obtained by running `embark-collect' from
within a minibuffer completion session.  In that case reverting
just restarts the completion session, that is, the command that
opened the minibuffer is run again and the minibuffer contents
restored.  You can then interact normally with the command,
perhaps editing the minibuffer contents, and, if you wish, you
can rerun `embark-collect' to get an updated buffer." t nil)

(autoload 'embark-live "embark" "\
Create a live-updating Embark Collect buffer.

(autoload 'embark-export "embark" "\
Create a type-specific buffer to manage current candidates.
The variable `embark-exporters-alist' controls how to make the
buffer for each type of completion.

Reverting an Embark Export buffer has slightly unusual behavior if
the buffer was obtained by running `embark-export' from within a
minibuffer completion session.  In that case reverting just
