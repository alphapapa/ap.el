;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The `standard-themes' are a pair of light and dark themes for GNU
;; Emacs.  They emulate the out-of-the-box looks of Emacs (which
;; technically do NOT constitute a theme) while bringing to them
;; thematic consistency, customizability, and extensibility.
;;
;; Why call them "standard"?  Obviously because: Standard Themes Are
;; Not Derivatives but the Affectionately Reimagined Default ... themes.
