Use minibuffer completion as the UI for `completion-at-point'.

The function is called with 4 arguments: START END COLLECTION PREDICATE.
The arguments and expected return value are as specified for
`completion-in-region'.  Use as a value for `completion-in-region-function'.

The function can be configured via `consult-customize'.

These configuration options are supported:

    * :cycle-threshold - Cycling threshold (def: `completion-cycle-threshold')
    * :completion-styles - Use completion styles (def: `completion-styles')
    * :require-match - Require matches when completing (def: nil)

(autoload 'consult-buffer "consult" "\
Enhanced `switch-to-buffer' command with support for virtual buffers.

The command supports recent files, bookmarks, views and project files as
virtual buffers.  Buffers are previewed.  Narrowing to buffers (b), files (f),
bookmarks (m) and project files (p) is supported via the corresponding
keys.  In order to determine the project-specific files and buffers, the
`consult-project-function' is used.  The virtual buffer SOURCES
default to `consult-buffer-sources'.  See `consult--multi' for the
configuration of the virtual buffer sources.

(fn &optional SOURCES)" t)
(autoload 'consult-project-buffer "consult" "\

(autoload 'consult-buffer-other-tab "consult" "\
Variant of `consult-buffer', switching to a buffer in another tab." t)
(autoload 'consult-grep "consult" "\
Search with `grep' for files in DIR where the content matches a regexp.

The initial input is given by the INITIAL argument.  DIR can be
nil, a directory string or a list of file/directory paths.  If
`consult-grep' is called interactively with a prefix argument,
the user can specify the directories or files to search in.
Multiple directories must be separated by comma in the
minibuffer, since they are read via `completing-read-multiple'.
By default the project directory is used if
`consult-project-function' is defined and returns non-nil.
Otherwise the `default-directory' is searched.

The input string is split, the first part of the string (grep
input) is passed to the asynchronous grep process and the second
part of the string is passed to the completion-style filtering.

The input string is split at a punctuation character, which is
given as the first character of the input string.  The format is
similar to Perl-style regular expressions, e.g., /regexp/.
Furthermore command line options can be passed to grep, specified
behind --.  The overall prompt input has the form
`#async-input -- grep-opts#filter-string'.

Note that the grep input string is transformed from Emacs regular
expressions to Posix regular expressions.  Always enter Emacs
regular expressions at the prompt.  `consult-grep' behaves like
builtin Emacs search commands, e.g., Isearch, which take Emacs
regular expressions.  Furthermore the asynchronous input split
into words, each word must match separately and in any order.
See `consult--regexp-compiler' for the inner workings.  In order
to disable transformations of the grep input, adjust
`consult--regexp-compiler' accordingly.

Here we give a few example inputs:

#alpha beta         : Search for alpha and beta in any order.
#alpha.*beta        : Search for alpha before beta.
#\\(alpha\\|beta\\) : Search for alpha or beta (Note Emacs syntax!)
#word -- -C3        : Search for word, include 3 lines as context
#first#second       : Search for first, quick filter for second.

The symbol at point is added to the future history.

(autoload 'consult-locate "consult" "\
Search with `locate' for files which match input given INITIAL input.

The input is treated literally such that locate can take advantage of
the locate database index.  Regular expressions would often force a slow
linear search through the entire database.  The locate process is started
asynchronously, similar to `consult-grep'.  See `consult-grep' for more
details regarding the asynchronous search.

(fn &optional INITIAL)" t)
(autoload 'consult-man "consult" "\
